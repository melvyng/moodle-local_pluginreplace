# pluginreplace
Plugin Replacer allows administrators to upload a Moodle plugin ZIP file and either:  - Install it (if not currently installed), or   - Replace the existing installed version.  This plugin works in specific scenarios where you don't have enough control to keep updating or installing plugins.
